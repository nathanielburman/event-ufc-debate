A new event where players da are and fight.

Oxford Teams Up with UFC in the Cage Match.

Two main times:
1. Lecture & Arguments

2. Ninjutsu Match of the Century!

Because, Elon and TimBukToo are both geniuses and rubbery boys and trained martial artists. 

But what would be the most interesting thing to me would be the arguments that they could have.

Free Speech and a bag of chips and a drink with that.

Oxford would have a small set of judges which would actually judge the debate.

UFC Judges will also judge the physical debate.

Both sides can amp up themselves and the crowd by making the fight about something besides them selves.

All fighters should be given a similar kind of right, the right to talk shit, right before you get a point.
